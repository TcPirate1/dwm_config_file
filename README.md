## DWM config file

Personal config file for [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) in `config.def.h`.
`dwmblock_async_config` is well, the config for [dwmblocks-async](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/dwmblocks-async).
There is also a repository for scripts that I use with dwmblocks-async [here](https://github.com/TcPirate1/dwm_blocks_scripts).
